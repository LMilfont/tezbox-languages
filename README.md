# TezBox Languages

This repo contains the main languages translation files used for TezBox. Feel free to work on translations and push updates (spelling mistakes, changes etc), or add new translations.

## New Translations

Simply duplicate the english.json file and rename it to the language you are translating too. Ensure the object keys/IDs are maintained, and only translate the value. E.g.
```
{
...
"error_please_enter_your_seed_words" : "Please enter your seed words"
...
}
```

You will leave **error_please_enter_your_seed_words** as it is, and just translate **Please enter your seed words**

## Paid Translations

We are currently looking to pay for full translations - please send a message to @TezBox_Wallet on Twitter with the language and the cost in USD to create a new translation
